# Predicting-Sales-based-on-Marketing-expenses

I picked a dataset from Kaggle which has the Marketing spend and Sales Data. Marketing is done via different channels - Radio/TV and social media and the dataset has numerical values in those columns which depicts spend in million dollars.

My goal was to create a Linear regression model which can predict sales based on other variables i.e marketing spend on TV, Radio and social media.

Initially to know more about data, I conducted statistical analysis in R and further developed a linear regression model using Python.

The "New Data" is the file which is used to use the model after it is fully developed to predict the sales.
